# bunny-farm-simulator
Simulates a farm of bunnies based on user-defined parameters

This was created as a part of my coursework for my Java class. The PopulationSimulator.java file contains the methods I created specifically for this project. ReturnPositive validates user input to make sure a number is > 0. BunniesRemaining runs all the calculations to output the amount of bunnies in a farm after a given amount of months. MonthsUntilPop calculates and returns the number of months it will take to reach a specific population of bunnies based on given parameters. All the output is to the console.
